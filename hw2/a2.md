# CSC494 - Assignment 2

Hope you all had fun doing Assignment 1!
Assignment 2 builds up on Assignment 1, and we learn more about file systems and performance implications of trace tools.

In this assignment we will be analyzing block trace logs of 3 different file systems - ext4, Btrfs and F2FS.
You should answer all questions and email a writeup titled CSC494.A2.pdf.

# 1. File Systems

Using the same workload disk setup that you created as part of Assignment 1, we now create different file systems on our workload disk.

## 1.1 ext4 file system

We first start with ext4. ext4 is a log structured file system. i.e. it maintains a log on which it updates metadata before updating the actual file system. Answer the following questions:

- Q1 - List the 3 different logging modes in ext4. How are they different from each other?
(Hint: look at the "data" option in mount command for ext4.

- Q2 - Which mode is the most efficient (high-performance) mode? Why? Is it reliable?

- Q3 - Which mode is the most reliabile mode? Why? Is it efficient?

## 1.2 Btrfs File System

The Btrfs file system is a Copy on write file system - i.e. it never updates a block in place. When an overwrite occurs, it writes to another position on the disk, making it very suitable for flash applications.

- Q1 - Create a btrfs File system on your workload device. Read the log that is created. In particular, look at "Metadata" parameter in "Block group Profiles".

- Q2 - Change the disk SSD, and recreate the btrfs file system. 
```
sudo su
echo “0” >  /sys/dev/block/8:16/queue/rotational
```

- Q3 - look at the "Metadata" parameter in "Block Group Profiles". Do you see a difference? What could be the reason for this difference between SSD and HDD mode?

We will be performing experiments in both SSD and HDD mode.

## 1.3 F2FS File System

Briefly go through the slides of F2FS file system [here](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/fast15_slides_lee.pdf)

- Q1 - Mention atleast 3 reasons (and elaborate) why F2FS is better than ext4 and Btrfs.

- Q2 - What type of workloads do you think would lead to performance drop in F2FS?

# 2 Performance and Efficiency Analysis

You will be repeating the following two experiments (dd and fio) for all three file systems. 
For ext4, you would analyze the file system for 3 journal modes - ordered, journal and writeback.
For btrfs, you will analyze the file system for HDD and SSD mode.
For f2fs, use the default mode.

For each mode, do the following two analysis:

## 2.1 dd

- Q1 - Use the dd command to write data to disk. fill the entire disk (do not use the count parameter). Vary block size (bs) parameter and plot the amount of time it takes for 5 different block sizes - 4K, 16K, 1M, 4M, 16M. One representation could be a clustered histogram of time taken for each block size. As shown below written in [gnuplot](https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/math/gnuplot). Feel free to use your own plot tools/scripts and add them to your report:

![](ext4/bar.png)

```python 
!/usr/bin/env gnuplot

set term postscript eps noenhanced color solid 22
set output 'bar.eps'

set style data histogram
set style histogram cluster gap 1

set key inside left

set xlabel 'Block Size'
set ylabel 'Time'

set style fill solid border rgb "black"
set auto x
set yrange [0:150]
plot 'ext4.dat' using 2:xtic(1) title col, \
        '' using 3:xtic(1) title col, \
        '' using 4:xtic(1) title col, \
        '' using 5:xtic(1) title col, \
        '' using 6:xtic(1) title col
```

- Q2 - Which block size takes least time to fill the disk across all 6 configurations (3 - ext4, 2 - btrfs and default f2fs mode). Plot data to justify your answer.
- Q3 - Which mode (for ext4, btrfs) is the fastest? Plot data to justify your answer.
- Q4 - Which file system is the fastest? Plot data to justify your answer.

## 2.2 fio

dd is an inefficient way to perform profiling of disks, as it is single threaded. Most real-world applications are multi-threaded and utilize the disk more efficiently. We now revisit fio and run the fio command with and without block trace. The objective is to find out if enabling or disabling block trace would lead to significant performance drop in fio. Note that disk throughput should ideally be higher with fio than with dd.

- Q1 - run fio on your device with 4 threads for 5 minutes. show the effect of varying any the following parameters on ext4(data=ordered mode), btrfs(SSD mode) and default F2FS mode:

1. readwrite
2. ioengine
3. iodepth
4. fsync
5. fdatasync

draw meaningful graphs (max -5 ) showing how each parameter effects each file systems I/O throughput and bandwidth.

- Q2 - re-run fio on your device for 5 mins, with 2 of the best configurations (maximum throughput) for all 3 file system modes that you ran in Q1. This time, enable blktrace. Report the amount of time taken, the drop in latency/throughput and size of the blkparse log that was created for the 6 runs (3 file systems X 2 configuration parameters).
